## Environment Configuration

After the recent security and performance improvements, you'll need to set up environment variables:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```

3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Recent Improvements

✅ **Security**: API keys are now loaded from environment variables
✅ **Performance**: Regex compilation optimized with static caching
✅ **Code Quality**: Eliminated HTTP request duplication
✅ **Maintainability**: Split large functions into focused methods
✅ **Error Handling**: Improved retry logic and error context
✅ **Reliability**: Better HTTP status code handling with backoff

## Next Steps

The critical improvements are complete! Consider implementing the "best-to-have" improvements next:
- LLM Client trait for better testability
- Architecture separation of concerns
- Frontend component breakdown
- Retry service jitter
- Configuration management
- Observability with tracing
